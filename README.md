# RESTful API w/ MongoDB Boilerplate Code

## Welcome
Hello! I created this basic boilerplate code for building a RESTful API server that utilizes CRUD and connects to a MongoDB database. It is as much documentation as it is open-source code for use in real web applications.

## Who Can Use This?
Anyone who wants to get started on bootstrapping a server for their project, or beginners trying to learn how this whole API thing works. This code is written heavily with comments so that each line is fully explained, hopefully making it easier for new back-end coders to learn.

***Enjoy***!
